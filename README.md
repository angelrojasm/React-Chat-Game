# React Chat App

This is a **very** simple chat application utilizing socket.io in a node.js + express backend for multiplayer interaction.

This application is a Proof of Concept on how to utilize sockets on an HTTP Server to communicate multiple react clients in real time. The Client application is also my first experience using React + Typescript and using Utility Classes with TailwindCSS to style my components without any css/scss files.

You can find the deployed version here: http://react-chat-app.herokuapp.com
